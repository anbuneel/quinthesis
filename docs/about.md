# About Quinthesis

**Quinthesis** is a multi-AI deliberation platform where multiple large language models collaboratively answer your questions through anonymized peer review.

## How It Works

1. **Stage 1** - Multiple AI models (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok) independently answer your question
2. **Stage 2** - Each model anonymously ranks and critiques the other responses
3. **Stage 3** - A lead model synthesizes the best insights into a final "Quintessence" answer

The name combines "quintessence" (the purest essence) with "synthesis" (combining ideas) — distilling the collective intelligence of frontier AI models into authoritative, well-reasoned answers.

## Key Features
