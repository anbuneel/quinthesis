- **Synthesis**: The combination of ideas into a coherent whole

## Name Analysis

### Strengths

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Semantic fit** | Perfect. Multiple AI perspectives synthesized into a *quintessential* answer. The "fifth element" metaphor resonates: models deliberate, and a refined essence emerges. |
| **Design alignment** | Matches the editorial "Paper of Record" aesthetic—sophisticated, slightly academic, gravitas. |
| **Memorability** | Distinctive, feels like a real word, easy to say: "kwin-THEH-sis" |
| **Versatility** | Works for domains, social handles, taglines |

### Considerations

| Aspect | Note | Mitigation |
|--------|------|------------|
| **Spelling** | Users may misspell as "Quintesis" or "Quinthesys" | Secure alternate domains as redirects |
| **Discovery** | Not self-explanatory | Pair with clear tagline: "Multi-AI deliberation" |
| **Pronunciation** | May need guidance | Add pronunciation in marketing: "kwin-THEH-sis" |

### Alternatives Considered

| Name | Notes | Decision |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Quorum** | "Council" / deliberation concept, but common | Rejected: too generic |
| **Consilium** | Latin for "council/advice", editorial feel | Rejected: harder to pronounce |
| **Quintile** | Simpler, relates to five | Rejected: less evocative |

---

## Recommendation

**Proceed with Quinthesis.**

The name elevates the product from a descriptive label ("AI Council") to an evocative brand that suggests transformation and refinement—exactly what the product delivers.
