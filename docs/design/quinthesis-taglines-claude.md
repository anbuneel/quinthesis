### 5. Minimal / Abstract

Maximum elegance, minimum words.

| Tagline | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Deliberate.** | One word, double meaning (verb/adjective) |
| **The synthesis.** | Simple, definitive |
| **Ask. Deliberate. Know.** | Three-step rhythm |
| **⁙** | Just the quincunx symbol (radical minimalism) |
